# Project2: ER Modeling & Schema Design

**This is a project 2 of Comp Sci 564: Database Management Systems: Design and Implementation of UW-Madison.**

## Project Goal

We are provided with a fairly large volume of data downloaded from the eBay web site and stored in JSON files. In this project, we examine the data and apply the principles of database design in order to implement a good relational schema for it. Then, we write a Python program to transform the data from its JSON form into SQLite's load file format, conforming to the relational schema. We will create our schema in a SQLite database, load the transformed data, and test it by running some SQL queries over it.
